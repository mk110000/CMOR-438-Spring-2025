# Principal Component Analysis

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while keeping as much important information (variance) as possible. It transforms your original data into a new set of features called **principal components**. In this example, PCA is followed by a **Decision Tree classifier** to make predictions using those simplified components.

## Dataset

The data used for this algorithm is from a health dataset focused on diabetes prediction. It contains information on individuals from various US states, with data ranging from 2015 to 2020.

In this dataset, the goal is to predict the presence of diabetes, represented by the `"diabetes"` column (`0 = no diabetes`, `1 = diabetes`). The dataset includes different variables that may influence diabetes risk, such as:

- **Demographics**: `"age"`, `"gender"`, `"location"`, and race indicators (e.g., `"race:AfricanAmerican"`, `"race:Asian"`, etc)
- **Health conditions**: `"hypertension"`, `"heart_disease"`
- **Lifestyle**: `"smoking_history"`
- **Medical indicators**: `"bmi"` (Body Mass Index), `"hbA1c_level"` (a key measure of blood sugar over time), and `"blood_glucose_level"`
- **Other**: `"clinical_notes"` (brief qualitative observations from a healthcare perspective)

By observing the data, we can see that diabetes risk is likely dependent on a combination of age, BMI, HbA1c level, glucose levels, and pre-existing health conditions. Race and lifestyle behaviors such as smoking history may also contribute to the prediction.

## Goal

The code aims to reduce the complexity of the data using **PCA**, then use a **Decision Tree** to predict whether a patient has diabetes. Reducing the number of features helps simplify the model, improve efficiency, and can sometimes improve accuracy by removing noise.
