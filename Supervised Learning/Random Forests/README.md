# Random Forests

**Random Forest** is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to make more accurate and stable predictions. It’s commonly used for classification problems like predicting whether a patient has diabetes.

## Dataset

The data used for this algorithm is from a health dataset focused on diabetes prediction. It contains information on individuals from various US states, with data ranging from 2015 to 2020.

In this dataset, the goal is to predict the presence of diabetes, represented by the `"diabetes"` column (`0 = no diabetes`, `1 = diabetes`). The dataset includes different variables that may influence diabetes risk, such as:

- **Demographics**: `"age"`, `"gender"`, `"location"`, and race indicators (e.g., `"race:AfricanAmerican"`, `"race:Asian"`, etc)
- **Health conditions**: `"hypertension"`, `"heart_disease"`
- **Lifestyle**: `"smoking_history"`
- **Medical indicators**: `"bmi"` (Body Mass Index), `"hbA1c_level"` (a key measure of blood sugar over time), and `"blood_glucose_level"`
- **Other**: `"clinical_notes"` (brief qualitative observations from a healthcare perspective)

By observing the data, we can see that diabetes risk is likely dependent on a combination of age, BMI, HbA1c level, glucose levels, and pre-existing health conditions. Race and lifestyle behaviors such as smoking history may also contribute to the prediction.

## Goal

The goal is to build and evaluate a **Random Forest model** to predict diabetes using patient data. The dataset is balanced using **SMOTE**, the model is trained, and its performance is assessed through accuracy and other metrics. It also identifies and visualizes the **most important features** used in the predictions.
